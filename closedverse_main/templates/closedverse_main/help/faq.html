        <p>Hey there! If you have any questions about this instance of Closedverse, this page aims to answer them.</p>
		<h2>Do eggs?</h2>
		<p>The world may never know.</p>
		<h2>Why won't my images appear?</h2>
		<p>the images has been uploaded, you just need to allow up to 5 minutes for nginx to update its cache</p>
        <h2>wtf is closedverse</h2>
		<p>Since i removed the entirety of the old faq, please <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mvclonapedia">go do some research.</a></p>
		<h2>Why are signups closed? (if they are)</h2>
		<p>something is probably happening and i couldnt be arsed to take more action other than close signups.<br>you can dm me on discord (@terminal10) and i can possibly let you sign up, though.</p>
		<h2>stop making clones</h2>
		<p>obviously that isn't going to happen anytime soon.
		<br>plus i already mentioned this on the front page memo.</p>
		<h2>who's writing this?</h2>
		<p>probably <a href="/users/Terminal">me</a> but it could be someone else if somebody comes to work on this</p>
		<h2>closedverse-le? beta closedverse?</h2>
		<p>rewrite of closedverse arian did in speedy node.js which was never finished</p>
