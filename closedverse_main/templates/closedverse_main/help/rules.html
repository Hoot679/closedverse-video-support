    <h2 class="label">{{ brand_name }} Rules</h2>
      <div class="help-content">
        <p>Like any other site, there are rules to keep it from dying. So,</p>
		
		<h2>NSFW</h2>
		<p>No NSFW <s>for now, please.</s> at all.</p>
		<h2>Gore</h2>
		<p>Gore, is forbidden everywhere. Please do not.</p>
		<h2>Illegal content</h2>
		<p>Nobody has a problem reporting you to the authorities if you do share illegal content here, so please do not.</p>
		<h2>Advertising</h2>
		<p>Unless you are a <b>verified</b> advertiser (this is to prevent shitty galaxy plaza rehosts from being advertised here)<br>You may <b>not</b> advertise. There is literally a designated place for that.</p>
		<h2>Piracy</h2>
		<p>what i mean by piracy is please don't do things like upload entire movies, or other weird shit. there's other places for that, and that could get me dmca'd. :(</p>
		<h2>Spam</h2>
		<p>Please do not spam. This includes Yeahing lots of things, following lots of people, sending lots of messages, etc. Just do what's necessary.</p>
		<h2>Hate speech</h2>
		<p>The policy is that if you're being reasonable, it's fine. If you're obnoxious and unreasonable with all of it, you will be warned.</p>
		<h2>Racism</h2>
		<p>No.</p>
		<h2>Hacking</h2>
		<p>If you're taking blind stabs at everything, consider <a href="https://github.com/ariankordi/closedverse">taking a look at the source</a>.
		<br>Login attempts are logged. Please do not do anything bad.</p>
		<h2>Public/joke accounts</h2>
		<p>They are unpleasant and nobody likes them. Please do not. You will be warned if you make a joke account, and public accounts (as in, accounts that have the password posted) will just be deleted.</p>
		<h2>Raids</h2>
		<p>Raid accounts will be deleted as soon as they exist. <b>If you're raiding another site, please do not discuss it here</b>.</p>
		<br>
		<hr>
		<h2>Repeals</h2>
		<p>If you want to be unbanned, try talking to an admin. Any form of contact is supported, they just need to get your message and we'll see if you can be unbanned.
		<br>This site was made by people who were mercilessly banned from many other sites without them accepting repeals, so we'll probably forgive you at some point.</p>
		<h2>Begging for moderator status</h2>
		<p>If you <i>only</i> beg for mod status and do nothing else on the service, you will probably be given a warning, if not a ban. Please do not.</p>
		<h2>Age</h2>
		<p>Please be 13+ to sign up. If you're under 13 i'll have to ban you until you turn 13 because of COPPA. No exceptions. (This is for your own safety. It may suck to have this rule but trust me)<br><small>But chances are, if you sign up and you're under 13 but you act mature enough nobody will notice</small></p>
		<br><hr>
		<h2>Wow, this is way too strict. I am dissatisfied.</h2>
		<p>that's unfortunate, sorry to hear that. but i have a pro tip for you:
		<br><small>Chances are that if you aren't unpleasant, not all of these rules will be strictly enforced.</small></p>
